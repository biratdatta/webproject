            Personal Website
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This website will be about me. It will be a professional website outlining my experience, academics, personal projects, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The objective of the website would be to provide potential employers a reliable reference and portfolio to outline what I can bring to the table. Also, it is something I can continue to update and work on beyond this class.
            </li>
            <li>
                My target audience would be myself, employers, and anyone taking a closer look at my professional life.
            </li>
            <li>
                I plan to include work experience, school experience, personal projects/hobbies, and contact information.
            </li>
        </ul>
