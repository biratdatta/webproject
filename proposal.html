        Project Proposal
    </h1>
    <hr>

    <div>
        <h2>
            Business Website
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This website would be about a food startup business I'm working on.
            </li>
            <li>
                The objective of the website would be to provide those who are interested in the business, customers, suppliers, investors, basic information about how the food is made, what's in it, where it's sold, about us, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                My target audience would mainly be customers and investors.
            </li>
            <li>
                I plan to include nutrition info, pricing info, company info, location info, contact info. 
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            Personal Website
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This website will be about me. It will be a professional website outlining my experience, academics, personal projects, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The objective of the website would be to provide potential employers a reliable reference and portfolio to outline what I can bring to the table. Also, it is something I can continue to update and work on beyond this class.
            </li>
            <li>
                My target audience would be myself, employers, and anyone taking a closer look at my professional life.
            </li>
            <li>
                I plan to include work experience, school experience, personal projects/hobbies, and contact information.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>
        I am still deciding on which to build -- I'm leaning more toward the personal website.
